Assigning outliers to detected by the Local Outlier Factor to the nearest neighbor (with iris dataset)

Local Outlier Factor is an unsupervised outlier determination algorithm. Computes the local density deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors. Proposed by Markus M. Breunig, Hans-Peter Kriegel, Raymond T. Ng and JÃ¶rg Sander in 2000.
